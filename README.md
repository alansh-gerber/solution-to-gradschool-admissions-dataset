# solution-to-gradschool-admissions-dataset
This is a common Codecadamy exercise given when users are completing their Tensorflow course, so I just wanted to share my answer.
The attached "admissions_data.csv" is the dataset off of which this project is based. The created model is a basic neural network that aims to estimate someone's ability to get into grad school based on a set of 7 features (serial number is excluded in computations).
